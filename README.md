# Build a (micro) cloud

Resources to build your own microclouds!

Right now this repo contains:

* A [script](/scripts/flash.sh) to automate flashing your Raspberry Pi nodes
* Code for a simple containerized app based on Minikube's hello-world example that you can use to smoke test your system (also available to pull on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mirailabs/hello-world))

We will be adding more useful resources to this repo as we experiment with our own microcloud.
